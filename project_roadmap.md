## ðŸ“š Project Concept: "ReadChain" or "BookBadge"

#### 2. Reading Proof Mechanism

**Page Progress Tracking:**
- Start time recorded
- Page updates tracking (every 10 pages or 10 minutes)
- Finish time recorded
- Minimum reading time required (based on book length)
  * Example: 300-page book requires at least 3 hours total reading time
  * Prevents instant "completion" fraud

**Quiz/Test System:**
- Short questions after finishing a book
- 5 questions per book (multiple choice)
- Questions cover: plot, characters, themes, key events
- Must score 60%+ to pass (3/5 correct)
- 3 attempts allowed (24-hour cooldown between attempts)
- Failed attempts still count toward "effort" metrics

**Optional Review Writing (Enhanced Rewards):**
- Optional but badge rewarded
- Minimum 100 words
- AI analysis for quality (using sentiment + structure analysis)
- Quality reviews unlock additional badge opportunities
- Review rewards:
  * Basic review = +25 READ bonus
  * Quality review = +50 READ bonus + eligible for review badges


#### 3. Token Economy

**READ Token:** Platform token earned through reading

**Earning READ Tokens:**
```
Book Completion:
- Complete book + pass quiz = 100 READ
- Complete book + pass quiz + write review = 150 READ
- Complete book + pass quiz + quality review = 200 READ

Daily Activities:
- Read 30+ minutes = 10 READ (once per day)
- 7-day reading streak = 50 READ bonus
- 30-day reading streak = 200 READ bonus

Social & Goals:
- Refer a friend (when they complete first book) = 300 READ
- Achieve yearly goal = 500 READ
- Join a book club = 50 READ (one-time)
- Participate in challenge = 100 READ

Monthly Maximum Earnings (Free Tier):
- 12 books Ã— 200 READ = 2,400 READ
- Daily reading (30 days Ã— 10) = 300 READ
- Streaks & bonuses = ~500 READ
- Total: ~3,200 READ/month possible
```

**READ Token Usage:**
```
Books & Content:
- Access to premium books = 500 READ per book
- Monthly unlimited pass = 500 READ
- Yearly unlimited pass = 5,000 READ (save 1,000)

Badges & Collectibles:
- Purchasing special badge collections = 1,000 READ
- Limited edition badge = 1,000 READ
- Seasonal special badge = 750 READ
- Author collaboration badge = 1,500 READ

Social Features:
- Gifting book to friend = 500 READ
- Create private book club = 100 READ
- Host reading challenge = 200 READ
- Spending for book recommendations = 100 READ

Profile & Customization:
- Custom profile theme = 250 READ
- Animated badge display = 500 READ
- Profile spotlight (1 week) = 300 READ
```

#### 4. Yearly Reading Limitation System

**Purpose:** Prevents gaming, creates fair competition, manages costs

**How It Works:**
```
Free Tier (Annual Limits):
- 12 free books per year (1 per month average)
- Unlimited re-reads of completed books
- Access to book previews (first 2 chapters)
- Can earn +3 bonus books through referrals

Premium Tier (Token-Based):
- Option A: Pay 500 READ tokens per additional book
- Option B: Premium Pass (5000 READ tokens/year) = Unlimited books
- Option C: Monthly Pass (500 READ tokens/month) = Unlimited books that month
```

**Benefits:**
- âœ… Prevents users from gaming daily reading rewards
- âœ… Creates value for READ tokens
- âœ… Makes yearly goals meaningful
- âœ… Reduces server/bandwidth costs for MVP
- âœ… Users are more intentional about book selection
### Stellar Integration (Revised)

#### 1. NFT Badge System (Simplified)
```
Asset Structure:
- Main badge asset: "READBADGE" (single trustline for all badges)
- Badge differentiation via metadata in memo field
- Each badge mint includes:
  * Badge ID (unique)
  * Badge type/category
  * Year (if applicable)
  * Achievement date
  * Book reference (if applicable)

Technical Implementation:
- Asset Code: "READBADGE" (under 12 chars âœ“)
- Issuer Account: Platform master account
- Distribution: Automated distribution account
- Metadata: Book information, completion date stored in IPFS
- IPFS hash in transaction memo
- Amount: 0.0000001 READBADGE per badge (effectively indivisible)
```

#### 2. READ Token
```
Asset Code: "READ"
Issuer: Platform token account
Platform native token
Initial Supply: 100,000,000 READ
Distribution:
- 40% User rewards pool
- 30% Development & operations
- 20% Marketing & partnerships
- 10% Team (2-year vesting)
```

#### 3. Smart Features

**Automatic Badge Distribution (Not Claimable):**
- When user earns badge, platform automatically sends
- Platform pays transaction fees
- Better UX, no friction
- User only needs ONE trustline to READBADGE asset

**Multi-sig Security:**
- Multi-signature system for platform administrators
- 2-of-3 multisig for issuer accounts
- Prevents single point of failure
- Secure badge minting

**Transaction Memo Standards:**
```json
{
  "type": "badge_mint",
  "badge_id": "MILESTONE_FIRST_BOOK",
  "user_id": "user_12345",
  "book_id": "book_789",
  "date": "2025-03-15",
  "metadata_ipfs": "QmX..."
}
```

### Yearly Goal System (New Feature)

#### How It Works:

**1. Goal Setting (January or Account Creation):**
```
User sets personal goal:
- Minimum: 6 books/year
- Maximum: 100 books/year
- Can set quarterly sub-goals
- Can adjust goal once per year (with penalty)

Example Goals:
- "I want to read 24 books in 2025" (2 books/month)
- Quarterly: 6 books per quarter
- Monthly: 2 books per month
```

**2. Goal Tracking Dashboard:**
```
Progress Display:
- Books completed: 15/24
- Current pace: "On track" / "Behind" / "Ahead"
- Projected finish: "You'll reach 28 books at current pace"
- Next milestone: "3 more books to reach Q2 goal"

Reminders:
- Weekly: "You're 2 books behind schedule"
- Monthly: "Complete 1 more book to stay on track"
- Quarterly: "You've met 75% of Q1 goal!"
```

**3. Goal Achievement Rewards:**
```
100% Goal = "Goal Crusher 2025" badge + 500 READ
110-149% = "Overachiever 2025" badge + 750 READ
150%+ = "Reading Legend 2025" badge + 1,000 READ
<100% but >75% = "Solid Effort 2025" badge + 250 READ

Monthly Consistency Bonus:
- Met monthly targets 12/12 months = "Consistent Reader" badge + 500 READ
```

**4. Goal Challenges (Community):**
```
Join Public Challenges:
- "100 Books in 2025" challenge
- "52 Books in 52 Weeks" challenge
- Genre-specific: "20 Sci-Fi Books This Year"

Benefits:
- Compete with others
- Shared leaderboard
- Challenge-specific badges
- Community motivation
```
