#### 2. Reading Proof Mechanism

**Page Progress Tracking:**
- Start time recorded
- Page updates tracking (every 10 pages or 10 minutes)
- Finish time recorded
- Minimum reading time required (based on book length)
  * Example: 300-page book requires at least 3 hours total reading time
  * Prevents instant "completion" fraud

**Quiz/Test System:**
- Short questions after finishing a book
- 5 questions per book (multiple choice)
- Questions cover: plot, characters, themes, key events
- Must score 60%+ to pass (3/5 correct)
- 3 attempts allowed (24-hour cooldown between attempts)
- Failed attempts still count toward "effort" metrics

**Optional Review Writing (Enhanced Rewards):**
- Optional but badge rewarded
- Minimum 100 words
- AI analysis for quality (using sentiment + structure analysis)
- Quality reviews unlock additional badge opportunities
- Review rewards:
  * Basic review = +25 READ bonus
  * Quality review = +50 READ bonus + eligible for review badges

#### 3. Token Economy

**READ Token:** Platform token earned through reading

**Earning READ Tokens:**
```
Book Completion:
- Complete book + pass quiz = 100 READ
- Complete book + pass quiz + write review = 150 READ
- Complete book + pass quiz + quality review = 200 READ

Daily Activities:
- Read 30+ minutes = 10 READ (once per day)
- 7-day reading streak = 50 READ bonus
- 30-day reading streak = 200 READ bonus

Social & Goals:
- Refer a friend (when they complete first book) = 300 READ
- Achieve yearly goal = 500 READ
- Join a book club = 50 READ (one-time)
- Participate in challenge = 100 READ

Monthly Maximum Earnings (Free Tier):
- 12 books Ã— 200 READ = 2,400 READ
- Daily reading (30 days Ã— 10) = 300 READ
- Streaks & bonuses = ~500 READ
- Total: ~3,200 READ/month possible
```

**READ Token Usage:**
```
Books & Content:
- Access to premium books = 500 READ per book
- Monthly unlimited pass = 500 READ
- Yearly unlimited pass = 5,000 READ (save 1,000)

Badges & Collectibles:
- Purchasing special badge collections = 1,000 READ
- Limited edition badge = 1,000 READ
- Seasonal special badge = 750 READ
- Author collaboration badge = 1,500 READ

Social Features:
- Gifting book to friend = 500 READ
- Create private book club = 100 READ
- Host reading challenge = 200 READ
- Spending for book recommendations = 100 READ

Profile & Customization:
- Custom profile theme = 250 READ
- Animated badge display = 500 READ
- Profile spotlight (1 week) = 300 READ
```

#### 4. Yearly Reading Limitation System

**Purpose:** Prevents gaming, creates fair competition, manages costs

**How It Works:**
```
Free Tier (Annual Limits):
- 12 free books per year (1 per month average)
- Unlimited re-reads of completed books
- Access to book previews (first 2 chapters)
- Can earn +3 bonus books through referrals

Premium Tier (Token-Based):
- Option A: Pay 500 READ tokens per additional book
- Option B: Premium Pass (5000 READ tokens/year) = Unlimited books
- Option C: Monthly Pass (500 READ tokens/month) = Unlimited books that month
```

**Benefits:**
- âœ… Prevents users from gaming daily reading rewards
- âœ… Creates value for READ tokens
- âœ… Makes yearly goals meaningful
- âœ… Reduces server/bandwidth costs for MVP
- âœ… Users are more intentional about book selection

### Stellar Integration with Soroban Smart Contracts

#### 1. Smart Contract Architecture (Rust + Soroban SDK)

**Core Contract Functions:**
```rust
// Badge Management
pub fn mint_badge(env: Env, user: Address, badge_type: Symbol, metadata: String) -> Result<u64, Error>
pub fn get_user_badges(env: Env, user: Address) -> Vec<Badge>
pub fn verify_badge_ownership(env: Env, user: Address, badge_id: u64) -> bool

// Token Operations
pub fn mint_read_tokens(env: Env, user: Address, amount: i128) -> Result<(), Error>
pub fn transfer_read_tokens(env: Env, from: Address, to: Address, amount: i128) -> Result<(), Error>
pub fn get_token_balance(env: Env, user: Address) -> i128

// Reading Progress
pub fn record_completion(env: Env, user: Address, book_id: String, quiz_score: u32) -> Result<(), Error>
pub fn get_reading_stats(env: Env, user: Address) -> ReadingStats

// Goal Tracking
pub fn set_yearly_goal(env: Env, user: Address, goal: u32, year: u32) -> Result<(), Error>
pub fn get_goal_progress(env: Env, user: Address, year: u32) -> GoalProgress
```

**Contract Data Structures:**
```rust
pub struct Badge {
    pub id: u64,
    pub badge_type: Symbol,
    pub owner: Address,
    pub metadata: String,
    pub mint_date: u64,
}

pub struct ReadingStats {
    pub total_books: u32,
    pub yearly_books: u32,
    pub current_streak: u32,
    pub total_read_earned: i128,
}

pub struct GoalProgress {
    pub goal: u32,
    pub completed: u32,
    pub percentage: u32,
}
```

#### 2. Asset Structure
```
READ Token:
- Asset Code: "READ"
- Type: Soroban Token (SAC - Stellar Asset Contract)
- Issuer: Platform contract account
- Initial Supply: 100,000,000 READ

READBADGE NFTs:
- Managed via Soroban contract
- Each badge is a unique entry in contract storage
- Metadata stored on-chain or IPFS hash reference
- Badge ID: Sequential counter
```

#### 3. Transaction Memo Standards
```json
{
  "type": "badge_mint",
  "badge_id": "MILESTONE_FIRST_BOOK",
  "user_id": "user_12345",
  "book_id": "book_789",
  "date": "2025-03-15",
  "metadata_ipfs": "QmX..."
}
```

### Yearly Goal System

#### How It Works:

**1. Goal Setting (January or Account Creation):**
```
User sets personal goal:
- Minimum: 6 books/year
- Maximum: 100 books/year
- Can set quarterly sub-goals
- Can adjust goal once per year (with penalty)

Example Goals:
- "I want to read 24 books in 2025" (2 books/month)
- Quarterly: 6 books per quarter
- Monthly: 2 books per month
```

**2. Goal Tracking Dashboard:**
```
Progress Display:
- Books completed: 15/24
- Current pace: "On track" / "Behind" / "Ahead"
- Projected finish: "You'll reach 28 books at current pace"
- Next milestone: "3 more books to reach Q2 goal"

Reminders:
- Weekly: "You're 2 books behind schedule"
- Monthly: "Complete 1 more book to stay on track"
- Quarterly: "You've met 75% of Q1 goal!"
```

**3. Goal Achievement Rewards:**
```
100% Goal = "Goal Crusher 2025" badge + 500 READ
110-149% = "Overachiever 2025" badge + 750 READ
150%+ = "Reading Legend 2025" badge + 1,000 READ
<100% but >75% = "Solid Effort 2025" badge + 250 READ

Monthly Consistency Bonus:
- Met monthly targets 12/12 months = "Consistent Reader" badge + 500 READ
```

**4. Goal Challenges (Community):**
```
Join Public Challenges:
- "100 Books in 2025" challenge
- "52 Books in 52 Weeks" challenge
- Genre-specific: "20 Sci-Fi Books This Year"

Benefits:
- Compete with others
- Shared leaderboard
- Challenge-specific badges
- Community motivation
```

cd readchain
npm install @stellar/stellar-sdk @creit.tech/stellar-wallets-kit
```

**Freighter Wallet Integration:**
```typescript
// lib/wallet.ts
import { isConnected, getPublicKey, signTransaction } from "@stellar/freighter-api";

export async function connectWallet() {
  if (await isConnected()) {
    const publicKey = await getPublicKey();
    return publicKey;
  }
  throw new Error("Freighter not installed");
}

export async function signTx(xdr: string) {
  const signedTx = await signTransaction(xdr, {
    network: "TESTNET",
    networkPassphrase: "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"
  });
  return signedTx;
}
```

**Contract Interaction Layer:**
```typescript
// lib/soroban.ts
import * as SorobanClient from "@stellar/stellar-sdk/lib/soroban";

export async function callContract(
  contractId: string,
  method: string,
  args: any[]
) {
  const contract = new SorobanClient.Contract(contractId);
  const operation = contract.call(method, ...args);
  
  // Build and submit transaction
  // Return result
}
```

### Phase 3: Backend API & Database (Week 5-6)

**Database Schema (Prisma):**
```prisma
// prisma/schema.prisma
model User {
  id            String   @id @default(cuid())
  walletAddress String   @unique
  username      String?
  email         String?  @unique
  createdAt     DateTime @default(now())
  
  completions   BookCompletion[]
  badges        BadgeOwnership[]
  goals         YearlyGoal[]
  reviews       Review[]
}

model Book {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  title       String
  author      String
  isbn        String?  @unique
  genre       String[]
  pageCount   Int
  epubUrl     String
  coverUrl    String
  
  completions BookCompletion[]
  quizzes     Quiz[]
}

model BookCompletion {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId      String
  bookId      String
  startedAt   DateTime
  completedAt DateTime?
  quizScore   Int?
  readingTime Int      // in minutes
  
  user User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  book Book @relation(fields: [bookId], references: [id])
}

model BadgeOwnership {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId    String
  badgeType String
  mintedAt  DateTime @default(now())
  txHash    String?
  
  user User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}
```

**API Routes:**
```
/api/auth/connect - Wallet connection
/api/books/list - Get available books
/api/reading/start - Start reading session
/api/reading/progress - Update progress
/api/reading/complete - Submit completion + quiz
/api/badges/mint - Trigger badge minting
/api/goals/set - Set yearly goal
/api/leaderboard - Get rankings
```

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Week 7-8)

**Integration Flow:**
1. User connects Freighter wallet â†’ Frontend calls `/api/auth/connect`
2. User starts reading â†’ Progress tracked in database
3. User completes book + quiz â†’ Backend verifies
4. Backend calls smart contract â†’ Badge minted on-chain
5. Frontend updates UI â†’ Shows new badge

**End-to-End Test:**
```typescript
// e2e/reading-flow.spec.ts
test("complete book and earn badge", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("/");
  await page.click("button:has-text('Connect Wallet')");
  // ... simulate Freighter connection
  
  await page.goto("/library");
  await page.click("text=1984");
  await page.click("text=Start Reading");
  
  // Simulate reading progress
  await page.click("text=Mark as Complete");
  
  // Take quiz
  await page.click("text=Answer A");
  // ...
  
  await expect(page.locator("text=First Book Ever")).toBeVisible();
});
```
