# Stellar-Based Book Reading Application - Project Plan

ðŸ“š Project Concept: "ReadChain" or "BookBadge"

## Core Features

### 1. Badge System (as NFTs)

A unique badge is earned upon completing each book

Each badge is minted as an NFT using Stellar's asset system

Examples:

- "First Book" badge
- "10 Books Reader" badge
- Genre-specific: "Sci-Fi Enthusiast", "Classic Reader"
- Author-specific: "Orhan Pamuk Collector"
- Speed badges: "1 Book Per Week"

### 2. Reading Proof Mechanism

- Quiz/Test: Short questions after finishing a book
- Page progress tracking
- Reading time recording: Start, page updates, Finish
- Optional writing a review: optional but badge rewarded

Badge suggestions:

- A "Critical Thinker" badge could be awarded for demonstrating sharp analysis or evaluation in a summary or review. NFT reward
- A "Curious Reader" badge might recognize reviews that explore deeper questions or unexpected insights. NFT reward
- A "Logical Reviewer" badge could be for clear, well-structured argumentation. NFT reward
- A "Grounded Justification" badge might reward thorough evidence or justification for claims made in the review. NFT reward
- Additional badges could reward effective questioning and reasoning skills expressed in the reviews. NFT reward
- If the review contains relative positive criticism, eligible for new constructive criticism badge and NFT reward
- If the review contains relative negative criticism, eligible for new flack badge and NFT reward
